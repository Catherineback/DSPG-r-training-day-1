## Intro to Markdown
Markdown allows you to do things like **bold**, __italicize__, and more!
Make a list with asteriks like: 
* bold with double-asterisks

* italics with underscores

* code-type fond with backticks

You can also use hyphens instead of astericks.

For a numbered list:
1. bold...
2. italic...
3. code...

Hyperlinks are like [Hyperlined text](https://mylinks.org)
